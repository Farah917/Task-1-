        <h1><b> <mark>Robert Downey Jr.</mark> playing iconic movie character for his next movie franchise </b></h1>
        <hr>
        <P> Hollywood may have no greater comeback story than <b> Robert Downey Jr. From his brilliant start as a Brat Pack actor to his wilderness
            years of substance abuse in the 1990s to his resurgence as the keystone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,he has really done it all in show 
            business, for good or bad.</b> But since leaving the role of <strong>Tony Stark/Iron Man with 2019â€™s Avengers: Endgame</strong>, he has struggled to find a 
            role that fits him quite as well as the acid-tongued, morally flexible superhero but there are some upcoming movies that'll thrill you.</p>
